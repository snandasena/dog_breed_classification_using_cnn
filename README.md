## Motivation <a name="motivation" ></a>
The objective of this particular project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to classify Dogâ€™s breed, and finally the built model is used to deploy in real world applications such as mobile , web or desktop applications. The application will accept any user supplied images as input, and if the model detected it as a dog then the model will predict their breed. Following is the potential output of the built model.


## Exploratory Data Analysis <a name="xpoanalysis"></a>
The below chart shows the distribution of dog breeds for total images and there are at least 61 images for 50% dog breeds.

## Results <a name="results"> </a>
The model was able to determine whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither. It predicted the correct dog breed for tested dogs.
