## Motivation <a name="motivation" ></a>
The objective of this particular project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to classify Dogâ€™s breed, and finally the built model is used to deploy in real world applications such as mobile , web or desktop applications. The application will accept any user supplied images as input, and if the model detected it as a dog then the model will predict their breed. Following is the potential output of the built model.
